# DICOM Multi-Reviewer System

## Project Overview

The DICOM Multi-Reviewer System is a collaborative medical imaging platform designed to reduce diagnostic errors in radiology through consensus review. It allows multiple radiologists to independently annotate the same medical images and then identifies and resolves discrepancies in their diagnoses.

## Core Features

- **DICOM Image Viewing:** Browser-based viewing of DICOM medical images
- **Annotation Tools:** Multi-shape drawing tools for identifying and marking areas of interest
- **User Authentication:** Role-based access with separate radiologist and admin views
- **Collaborative Review:** Tools to enable multiple radiologists to review the same studies
- **Discrepancy Detection:** Automatic identification of spatial, classification, and presence discrepancies between reviewers
- **Consensus Building:** Tools to facilitate reaching consensus on discrepant findings
- **Persistent Annotations:** Annotations are saved to the database and preserved between sessions

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- pip package manager
- Git
- SQLite (included with Python)

### DICOM Test Files

The system requires DICOM files for testing and development. We recommend using:

1. **MAGNETOM Free.Max Sample Data**: Publicly available sample DICOM files from Siemens Healthineers
2. **Orthanc Sample Files**: Anonymous DICOM files available at [orthanc-server/orthanc-setup-samples](https://github.com/orthanc-server/orthanc-setup-samples/tree/master/dicomFiles)

For proper setup, place your DICOM files in a directory named `dicom-files` in the same parent directory as the `multi-reviewer` folder:

```
dicom-research/
â”œâ”€â”€ multi-reviewer/    # Main application code
â””â”€â”€ dicom-files/       # DICOM test files
```

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dicom-multi-reviewer.git
cd dicom-multi-reviewer
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Update the DICOM directory path in `src/dicom_reviewer/main.py` if needed:
```python
DICOM_DIR = '../dicom-files'  # Relative path to DICOM files directory
```

5. Run the application:

**For standard Ubuntu/Linux systems:**
```bash
cd multi-reviewer
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
python src/dicom_reviewer/main.py
```

**For Windows WSL environment:**
```bash
cd multi-reviewer
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python src/dicom_reviewer/main.py
```

6. Access the application at: http://localhost:5000

### Default Accounts

Upon first startup, the system creates two default accounts:

**Admin Account**
- Username: admin
- Password: admin
- Role: Administrator (can view all annotations)

**Radiologist Account**
- Username: radiologist1
- Password: password
- Role: Radiologist (can only view/edit own annotations)
